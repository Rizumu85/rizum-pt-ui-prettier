# project module

This module allows to open, create, save and close projects, and change some of their properties.

First, here is a complete example showing how to use this module:

```python
import substance_painter.project

# A few declarations used in this example:
workFolder = "C:/MyWorkDir"
meshFile = workFolder+"/MeetMat.FBX"
templateFile = workFolder+"/MyTemplate.spt"
mySettings = substance_painter.project.Settings(
    import_cameras=True,
    normal_map_format=substance_painter.project.NormalMapFormat.OpenGL)

# This should print nothing if you just opened Substance 3D Painter,
# since no project is opened:
if substance_painter.project.is_open():
    print("There is already a project opened!")


# Create a project from a file, import cameras from the file, and set up
# the project for OpenGL:
substance_painter.project.create(mesh_file_path=meshFile, settings=mySettings)

# Show the current state of the project:
if substance_painter.project.is_open():
    print("The project was successfully created.")
if substance_painter.project.needs_saving():
    print("The project hasn't been saved yet.")
# At this stage the file path is empty:
print("The file path of the project is: '{0}'"
    .format(substance_painter.project.file_path()))


# Save the project to a file:
substance_painter.project.save_as(workFolder+"/MyNewProject.spp") # No errors
if not substance_painter.project.needs_saving():
    print("As expected, there is nothing to save since this was just done.")
print("The file path of the project is now: '{0}'"
    .format(substance_painter.project.file_path()))
print("The name of the project is now: '{0}'"
    .format(substance_painter.project.name()))

# ...
# Do some painting here.
# ...

# Create a backup copy of the project, but keep on working on the initial project:
substance_painter.project.save_as_copy(workFolder+"/MyBackupProject.spp")
if not substance_painter.project.needs_saving():
    print("Even though a back copy was made, the project still has to be saved.")
print("The file path of the project is still: '{0}'"
    .format(substance_painter.project.file_path()))

# ...
# Do some more painting here.
# Suppose you make a terrible mistake and want to revert to the backup copy.
# ...

# Close the current project; all unsaved changes are lost!
substance_painter.project.close()
if not substance_painter.project.is_open():
    print("No project is opened anymore.")

# Open the backup copy:
substance_painter.project.open(workFolder+"/MyBackupProject.spp")
if substance_painter.project.is_open()
    print("Our project is back!")


# We can save a template from the project:
substance_painter.project.save_as_template(templateFile, "01_Head")
substance_painter.project.close()

# We can now create a new project with that template file:
substance_painter.project.create(mesh_file_path=meshFile,
                                 template_file_path=templateFile)

# End of our little example...
substance_painter.project.close()
```

## Creating a project

Example:

```python
import substance_painter.project

# Use OpenGL / right handed normal map format:
ogl_normal_map_format = substance_painter.project.NormalMapFormat.OpenGL

# Use per vertex tangent space:
per_vertex_tangent = substance_painter.project.TangentSpace.PerVertex

# Declare the settings for the project:
project_settings = substance_painter.project.Settings(
    import_cameras=True,
    normal_map_format=ogl_normal_map_format,
    tangent_space_mode=per_vertex_tangent)

# A list of maps to use:
maps = ["C:/Documents/DefaultMaterial_ambient_occlusion.png",
    "C:/Documents/DefaultMaterial_id.png"]

# Create the project with those settings:
substance_painter.project.create(
    mesh_file_path = "C:/Documents/my_mesh.fbx",
    mesh_map_file_paths = maps,
    settings = project_settings)


# If this is a project with UDIMs, we need to choose the workflow:
uv_tile_workflow = substance_painter.project.ProjectWorkflow.UVTile

# Declare the settings for the project:
project_settings = substance_painter.project.Settings(
    import_cameras=True,
    normal_map_format=ogl_normal_map_format,
    tangent_space_mode=per_vertex_tangent,
    project_workflow=uv_tile_workflow)

# A list of maps to use (in this example, the file name indicates a
# a sequence of potentially several UDIMs; the project will load all
# of them without having to list them individually):
maps = ["C:/Documents/DefaultMaterial_ambient_occlusion.1001.png"]

# Create the project with those settings:
substance_painter.project.create(
    mesh_file_path = "C:/Documents/my_mesh_with_UDIMs.fbx",
    mesh_map_file_paths = maps,
    settings = project_settings)
```

**`substance_painter.project.create(mesh_file_path: str, mesh_map_file_paths: List[str] | None = None, template_file_path: str | None = None, settings: Settings = Settings(...))`**

Create a new project. If an `OCIO` environment variable is set, pointing to a .ocio configuration file, the project is setup to use the OCIO color management mode defined by that file. If the configuration defined by that file is invalid, a `ProjectError` is raised and no project is created. Similarly, if a `PAINTER_ACE_CONFIG` environment variable is set, pointing to a .json preset file, the project is setup to use the ACE color management mode defined by that file. If the preset defined in that file is invalid, a `ProjectError` is raised and no project is created. If both environment variables are set, `OCIO` will be used. If there is not such environment variable, the project uses the Legacy color management mode.

> **Note:** Project settings override the template parameters.

**Parameters:**
- **mesh_file_path** (*string*) – File path of the mesh to edit. Supported file formats: fbx, obj, dae, ply, usd.
- **mesh_map_file_paths** (*list of string*) – Paths to the additional mesh maps.
- **template_file_path** (*string*) – Template file path to use to create the project.
- **settings** (*Settings*) – Configuration options of the new project.

**Raises:**
- **ProjectError** – If Substance 3D Painter cannot create the project.
- **ProjectError** – If there is already an opened project.
- **ProjectError** – If an `OCIO` environment variable is set to an invalid configuration.
- **ProjectError** – If an `PAINTER_ACE_CONFIG` environment variable is set to an invalid preset.
- **ServiceNotFoundError** – If Substance 3D Painter has not started all its services yet.
- **TypeError** – If `settings` is not an instance of Settings.
- **ValueError** – If the file format of `mesh_file_path` is not supported.
- **ValueError** – If the mesh file `mesh_file_path` does not exist.
- **ValueError** – If any of the mesh map files in `mesh_map_file_paths` do not exist.
- **ValueError** – If the template file `template_file_path` doesn't exist.
- **ValueError** – If the template file `template_file_path` is invalid.
- **ValueError** – If `settings` are not valid project settings.
- **ValueError** – If `settings.default_texture_resolution` is not a valid resolution.

                                    substance_painter.project.ProjectSaveMode.Full)
# This should print "c:/Documents/project1.spp":
print(substance_painter.project.file_path())

# Change the name of the project to "project2":
substance_painter.project.save_as("c:/Documents/project2.spp")
# This should now print "c:/Documents/project2.spp":
print(substance_painter.project.file_path())

# Create a backup copy of the project:
substance_painter.project.save_as_copy("c:/Documents/project2-backup.spp")
# This should still print "c:/Documents/project2.spp":
print(substance_painter.project.file_path())

substance_painter.project.save_as_template(
    "c:/Documents/Adobe/Substance 3D Painter/assets/templates/template.spt",
    "DefaultMaterial")
```

**`substance_painter.project.needs_saving() → bool`**

Check if the current project needs to be saved.

**Returns:** `True` if the project has modifications and needs to be saved, `False` otherwise.

**`substance_painter.project.save(mode: ProjectSaveMode = ProjectSaveMode.Incremental) → None`**

Save the current project by overwriting the previous save.

> **Note:** Save is disabled when Substance 3D Painter is busy and will throw a ProjectError.

**Parameters:**
- **mode** (*ProjectSaveMode*) – The save mode (Incremental or Full).

**`substance_painter.project.save_as(project_file_path: str, mode: ProjectSaveMode = ProjectSaveMode.Incremental) → None`**

Save the current project by writing it to the file path `project_file_path`.

> **Note:** If the path `project_file_path` doesn't exist yet, new folders will be created as needed. Save is disabled when Substance 3D Painter is busy and will throw a ProjectError.

**Parameters:**
- **template_file_path** (*string*) – The save path.
- **texture_set_name** (*string*) – Name of the Texture Set used as a template.

**`class substance_painter.project.ProjectSaveMode(value)`**

Save strategy enumeration.

**Members:**
- `Full` – Save everything in a new file. Slow but creates the smallest possible file.
- `Incremental` – Save only new or modified data. Fast but the file size is not optimal.

## Reloading a mesh

Example:

```python
import substance_painter.project

# Declare the settings for the new mesh loading:
mesh_reloading_settings = substance_painter.project.MeshReloadingSettings(
    import_cameras=True,
    preserve_strokes=True)

# Function that will be called when reloading is finished:
def on_mesh_reload(status: substance_painter.project.ReloadMeshStatus):
    import substance_painter.project
    if status == substance_painter.project.ReloadMeshStatus.SUCCESS:
        print("The mesh was reloaded successfully.")
    else:
        print("The mesh couldn't be reloaded.")

# Reload the current mesh:
substance_painter.project.reload_mesh(
    'c:/Documents/my_mesh.fbx',
    mesh_reloading_settings,
    on_mesh_reload)
```

**`substance_painter.project.reload_mesh(mesh_file_path: str, settings: MeshReloadingSettings, loading_status_cb: Callable[[ReloadMeshStatus], Any])`**

Import a new mesh to the current project, using the given settings. Uses the automatic UV unwrapping settings defined at the project level.

The loading is asynchronous: this function returns immediately; when the loading attempt is finished `loading_status_cb` is called with an argument indicating if loading was successful.

**Parameters:**
- **mesh_file_path** (*string*) – File path of the mesh to edit. Supported file formats: fbx, obj, dae, ply, usd.
- **settings** (*MeshReloadingSettings*) – Configuration options for the mesh loading.
- **loading_status_cb** (*Callable[[ReloadMeshStatus], Any]*) – Loading status notification callback.

**`substance_painter.project.last_imported_mesh_path() → str`**

Return the path to the last imported mesh.

**Returns:** The file path of the mesh that was last imported to the project.

**`class substance_painter.project.MeshReloadingSettings(import_cameras: bool = True, preserve_strokes: bool = True, mesh_settings: UsdSettings | None = None)`**

Settings used when reloading a mesh.

**Parameters:**
- **import_cameras** (*bool*) – Import cameras from the mesh file.
- **preserve_strokes** (*bool*) – Preserve strokes positions on mesh.
- **mesh_settings** (*UsdSettings*) – Specific settings for USD files.

**`class substance_painter.project.ReloadMeshStatus(value)`**

Reload mesh status, used in mesh reload asynchronous callback.

**Members:**
- `ERROR` – Mesh reload failed, see application log for details.
- `SUCCESS` – Mesh reload was successful.

## Project metadata

**`class substance_painter.project.Metadata(context: str)`**

Project metadata are arbitrary data that can be attached to a Substance Painter project. When the project is saved, the metadata are saved with it, so it is still available the next time the project is loaded.

Metadata can only be accessed when a project is opened. If no project is opened, the methods will raise an exception.

The constructor of the class `Metadata` takes a context name as an argument. This context name can be for example the name of your plugin. It should be unique, to avoid conflict with other plugins.

### Example

```python
import substance_painter

# Instantiate the Metadata utility, for the plugin "MyPlugin".
metadata = substance_painter.project.Metadata("MyPlugin")

# Store a version number under the key "version".
plugin_version = { "major": 1, "minor": 0 }
metadata.set("version", plugin_version)

# List the project's metadata keys. The key "version" is now present.
keys = metadata.list()
print(keys)

# Retrieve the metadata "version".
plugin_version = metadata.get("version")
print("Version: " + str(plugin_version))
```

**Parameters:**
- **context** (*str*)

**`list() → list`**

Return the list of project metadata keys.

**`get(key: str)`**

Retrieve the project metadata under the given key.

The supported data types are:
- Primitive types: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`.
- `list` – Items can be any of the supported data types.
- `dict` – Keys must be of type `str`. Values can be any of the supported data types.

**Parameters:**
- **key** (*str*) – The key identifying the metadata to retrieve.

**`set(key: str, value)`**

Store project metadata under the given key.

The supported data types are:
- Primitive types: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`.
- `list` – Items can be any of the supported data types.
- `dict` – Keys must be of type `str`. Values can be any of the supported data types.

**Parameters:**
- **key** (*str*) – The key identifying the metadata to store.
- **value** – The metadata to store.

## Events

Project related operations, whether they are initiated through the Python API or in the UI, can trigger the following events. See `substance_painter.event` for more details.

> **Note:** Project loading is done asynchronously. When the event `ProjectOpened` or `ProjectCreated` is triggered, the project may still be loading. The event `ProjectEditionEntered` is triggered when the project is ready to work with.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectOpened`**

Event triggered when an existing project has been opened.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectCreated`**

Event triggered when a new project has been created.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectAboutToClose`**

Event triggered just before closing the current project.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectAboutToSave(file_path: str)`**

Event triggered just before saving the current project.

**Parameters:**
- **file_path** (*str*) – The destination file.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectSaved`**

Event triggered once the current project is saved.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectEditionEntered`**

Event triggered when the project is fully loaded and ready to work with.

When edition is entered, it is for example possible to query/edit the project properties, to bake textures or do project export.

**`class substance_painter.event.ProjectEditionLeft`**

Event triggered when the current project can non longer be edited.
