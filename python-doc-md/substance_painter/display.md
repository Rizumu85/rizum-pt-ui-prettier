# display module

This module exposes functions that change how the model of a project is presented in the viewports. They correspond to settings available in the "Display Settings" window.

The Environment Map used to light the scene can be retrieved with `get_environment_resource()`, or set with `set_environment_resource()`. The look up table (LUT) used as a Color Profile can be retrieved with `get_color_lut_resource()`, or set with `set_color_lut_resource()`.

## Example

```python
import substance_painter.display

# Show the currently used color profile:
color_lut = substance_painter.display.get_color_lut_resource()
if (color_lut != None):
    print(color_lut.url())
else:
    print("No color profile is used.")

# Set a different color profile:
new_color_lut = substance_painter.resource.ResourceID(context="starter_assets",
                                                      name="sepia")
substance_painter.display.set_color_lut_resource(new_color_lut)

# Show the currently used environment map:
envmap = substance_painter.display.get_environment_resource()
print(envmap.url())

# Set a different environment map:
new_envmap = substance_painter.resource.ResourceID(context="starter_assets",
                                                   name="Bonifacio Street")
substance_painter.display.set_environment_resource(new_envmap)

# Show the currently active tone mapping operator:
try:
    tone_mapping = substance_painter.display.get_tone_mapping()
    print(tone_mapping)
except RuntimeError:
    print("The project is color managed; tone mapping is not available")

# Set a different tone mapping:
try:
    new_tone_mapping = substance_painter.display.ToneMappingFunction.ACES
    substance_painter.display.set_tone_mapping(new_tone_mapping)
except RuntimeError:
    print("The project is color managed; tone mapping is not available")
```

## Classes and Functions

### ToneMappingFunction

```python
class substance_painter.display.ToneMappingFunction(value)
```

Tone mapping function used in display.

This corresponds to the "Tone mapping" list in the "Camera settings" section of the "Display settings" view.

**Members:**

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Linear` | Transformation from linear to sRGB without any color remapping. Color values above 1 are clamped. |
| `ACES` | Use the standard color remapping from the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES). |

> **Note:** The name used to define members is available as a string via the `.name` attribute (see [python enum.Enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.Enum)).

### get_tone_mapping()

```python
substance_painter.display.get_tone_mapping() → ToneMappingFunction

**Return type:** ToneMappingFunction

**Raises:**
- **RuntimeError** – If the project is color managed.
- **ProjectError** – If no project is opened.
- **ServiceNotFoundError** – If Substance 3D Painter has not started all its services yet.

# Get the main camera
camera = substance_painter.display.Camera.get_default_camera()

# Update camera properties
camera.projection_type = substance_painter.display.CameraProjectionType.Perspective
